### An Unexpected Discovery
Taking the first step towards becoming a Software Engineering student began with, of all things, an Instagram post that happened to catch my eye one lazy afternoon. As over-saturated as Instagram can be in terms of content vying for your attention, this particluar post stood out; A Victoria's Secret model who was also an accomplished programmer being trolled by hateful comments strongly suggesting women are not capable enough for tech. 

As a headstrong woman who has always been enamoured with typically male-dominated interests such as video games, technology, space, science fiction/fantasy entertainment, comics, renaissance fairs, weaponry, etc this struck me as both incredibly offensive and innacurate. While I knew very little about programming and what it entailed at the time, I felt drawn to look into it further and see what all the fuss was about. After all, if an already successful model found it to be worth the significant time and effort that it would take to learn multiple programming languages there must be something keeping her motivated to strive further.

### Getting A Taste
Now that my interest had been piqued, I proceeded to do some googling and soon began taking some Python lessons on Codecademy. Right off the bat I knew I had found something special; a potential career that I could be genuinely interested in and passionate about. Each new piece of information I learned had me hooked and excited to learn more. As strange as this may sound to some, that was the first time in my entire life I had ever felt that way. I was thrilled to have finally found something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life and most importantly, actually enjoy it.

### Perseverance Pays Off
Unfortunately, life likes to throw curveballs. After the initial flurry of activity I had to put it in on the back burner and focus on other tasks at hand that demanded my full attention, resulting in over a year passing. I often wondered if I would ever have the opportunity to pursue prgramming again. That is, until I once again came across an Instagram post that would put me on the path to achieving my dream; an advertisement for Flatiron School. I promptly applied, and from the very existence of this blog post the outcome is clear; I am now a Part-Time Software Engineering student! I have the opportunity to utilize my determination, intelligence and hard work to strive towards a better future for myself and those I may potentially impact in the days, months and years to come. 

I chose to study Software Engineering because I chose happiness and success, and I deserve nothing less!
